# goblin_sapper

Structure:
    Interface:
        Parse arguments
        Possibly use shunting yard algorithm
        Ensure no overflows can happen
        Possibly make a hash table, mostly because I've never made one before
            also, it's fast

    Modules:
        -h, --help
        -v, --version
        -s

        Each of these should have their own function that would be called in the interface.
    Utilities
        The only thing that comes to mind for ultilities is text formatting for the help module
        I'll just have this just in case I need it.


Future Features:
    
    - Creates a bash script payload that opens a reverse shell
    - Creates a listener socket for reverse shells
    - Simulate wget
